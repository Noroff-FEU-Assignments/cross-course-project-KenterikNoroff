Link to XD Design 1.

## Brief

You have been tasked with developing the home page of the prototype you build in design 1.

The home page should:

1.  be responsive across screen sizes

2.  Use neat and semantic HTML

3.  have CSS that follows DRY principle

## Level 1 process

1.  Create the HTML for your home page. Use HTML5 elements where appropirate and remember to write unique title for the page, as well as ensure your pages are WCAG compliant.

2.  Create a CSS file which is linked to your home page.

3.  Consider how your page will look across various screen sizes (eg. Single column on mobil, multi-column on larger screens).

4.  Write your CSS following the DRY principle.

5.  Ensure you´re making regular commits to your repository. you must use the repository you created on GitHub Classroom in web and Communications technology. Remember you can veiw the files locally on your computer before you push changes top your repository.

6.  Submit a link to the deployed site on Netlify

## Additional Comments

For your Course Assignment for this course, you will deliver a functional, responsive website of the prototype, but for now we’re just focusing on the home page. You can add other pages to your repository, but the focus will be on the home page.

Certain aspects of your original design might not be possible without JavaScript, and you can either leave these off the HTML and CSS submission or use techniques (like the checkbox hack) to mimic the interactions. For example, you might have an add-to-cart interaction. This can be achieved using the checkbox hack like so: https://jsfiddle.net/MJPhillip/0a5vqk43/
